bulkip:

  # Specifies the input files containing IP addresses and
  # optional timing information. Each item can be an explicit
  # file, a file glob pattern (as in shell globs), or a directory.
  # All files are opened and read together, collated by the time
  # value in the lines of the file, if present.
  input_files:
    - spec/bulkip/ex5.log

  # If time values are present, all input files are collated together
  # by ascending time value. Each file must have time values given in
  # ascending order. In cases where this cannot be completely assured,
  # each file is buffered and sorted as it is read. This value controls
  # the size of this line buffer. The default is 5 lines.
  #sorted_line_buffer_size: 5

  # The basename of the TSV files that will be generated. Each file
  # will have the .tsv extension added to it.
  # Both TSV and CSV may be specified, but atleast one is required.
  tsv_output: <%= @file_out %>

  # The basename of the CSV files that will be generated. Each file
  # will have the .csv extension added to it.
  # Both TSV and CSV may be specified, but atleast one is required.
  csv_output: <%= @file_out %>

  # Separate files are generated sorted by the top number of observatons,
  # observations per observed period, and magnitude. By default, the file
  # is limited to the top 100. This value can change the limitation value.
  top_scores: 2

  # If looking up each line of the input files is not feasible, then
  # sampling can be done. This value specifies the number of seconds
  # to randomly skip according to the time values on the lines in the
  # input files.
  #sampling_interval: 60

  # possible values are NONE, SOME, ALL
  messages: NONE

  # The maximum age an item from the cache will be used.
  # This value is in seconds
